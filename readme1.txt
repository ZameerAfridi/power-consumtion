So first will open Anconda Navigator 
Next Launch jupyter notebook, it will redirect to browser
Goto folder where your file is -->Desktop-->Project-->notebook file

Can Run the whole code at once --> Goto Cell --> Run all
or else cell by cell --> click on the cell and click run option

Note: Make sure u have to run the cells from strt 1,2,3,...

* mark means the cell is running
As you have two files, now will run another file
power_using_ML.ipynb --> file include machine learning supervised algorithm
power_using_lstm.ipynb --> file include Deep learning neural netwrok i.e. LSTM model

so here it is module error, which means module not there in system u need to install 
there are two ways to install - 

1. through anaconda prompt
2. throuhg jupyter notebook cell

packages to be download (this process will require only for the first time)
1. pip install keras
2. pip install tensorflow
